# Customer Churn Prediction App
This project is a web-based application for predicting customer churn.
It uses a deep learning model trained on customer data to provide insights into whether a given customer is likely to churn or not. 
The model takes various inputs such as contract type, monthly charges, total charges,tenure,gender and paperless billing to make predictions.

## Data Preprocessing

- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`datasets_13996_18858_WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`).
- Irrelevant columns like 'customerID' are dropped.
- Data types are checked and converted, and missing values are handled appropriately.
